# 09 — Generator Guarantees (Grammar-aware)

Generators may assume:

## Grammar guarantees
- every legality set/vocabulary is non-empty
- transition matrices are normalized where required
- cadence typology is non-empty
- grid policy and onset legality are coherent

## Control guarantees
- all ResolvedControls fields are canonical
- all legality-related controls are subsets of Grammar legality
- all weight maps normalized
- plans consistent with bars and cadence typology

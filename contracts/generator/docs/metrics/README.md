# Metrics (Generator Output Proofs)

These metrics are computed from generated events to prove UI choices affect audio.

At minimum compute:
- pitch_class_histogram
- interval_histogram
- chord_tone_ratio
- non_diatonic_pitch_rate
- syncopation_index
- backbeat_strength
- swing_ratio
- motif_similarity
- cadence_type_distribution_at_phrase_ends
- quantization_error
